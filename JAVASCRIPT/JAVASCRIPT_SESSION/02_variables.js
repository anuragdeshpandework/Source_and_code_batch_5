// comments --> comments are the line wrriten in  code which are used to explain the code and this line
// are igonred by browser or complier 

// what is use of comment -> 
// 1 it will make your code more readable 
// 2 it will make your code easy to maintain 
// 3 it will make your code easy to understand 


// There are two comments in js 
// 1 single line comment --> (//)
// example this is single line comment --> and it has a range only till this single line 


// 2 mutli-line comment --> (/*this is starting point                       */ this will be ending point)

/* example 
this is 
a 
multi line 
comment 
*/

/*
comment etiqutes :-->
1 use comments to explain a complex logic or algorithms
2 Avoid abnoxious comments that do not add value 
3 keep the comments up to date with code changes 
4 comments should be consise and clear to understand

/**
 * Rules to keep in mind when delacring avariable
 *1 varaible name should not start with a number */
let demo1 = "sid" // this is valid example 
// let 1demo= "sid" //this is invalid example

//2 varaible name can only contain letter , numbers ,underscore ( _ ) & dollar sign $ 

let $demo2 = "demo function" // valid 
let demo = "demo function" // valid 
let demo_ = "valid " // valid 

// invalid example 

// let demo@ = "invalid" // invalid 
// let demo number = "invalid" // invaild example there should no space in varaibles name 

//3 varaible are case senstive 

let name = "siddhant" // this is variable with name
let Name = "arjun" // this is vraible with Name

// the above two in js are two seprate variable

//4 varaible names cannot included reserved keyword

//let var = "2" // this is invalid becasue var is reserved keyword

//bonus Rule -->
// your variable name should always be decriptive of the value and  be in camel case
//example
let user_Age = "28" // this valid 

let userName = " valid example "



// example delecare varaibles 

// 1 delcare 2 variable in a single line 

let firstName = "siddhant", lastName = "gadakh"

// 2 delecare 2 varaible in multiple line 

let varaibale1 = "sid"
let varaible2 = "gaadakh"



/** DATATYPE IN JS 
 There are mainly two type of datatype in js 
1) primitive data type --> The data type which is simple in nature and is immutable (cannot change its or property)

2) non-primitive data  --> The data type which is complex in nature and is mutable (can change its value or property)



// primitive datatype in js 

1 Number --> it represent any numerical value eg (-infity to +infity) (eg -0.32564 , 100 , 522 ,5555555555555555555555555)
(intergers and floating numbers)

2 String --> it represent any caharcter or sequnece of character that is wrapped into "double quotes ", 'single quotes' `backticks`

let str = "siddhant     " // this is string
let str2 = '28'          // this is also a string
let str3 =`    ` // this is also a string 


3 Boolean --> it represents the true and false value in js 


let value1 = true // this is boolean value
let value2 = false // this is also aboolean value 

4 undefined --> it represents a varaible whos value has not been assigned yet 
let name   // this is example of undefined

5 null --> it represent nothingness 
let name = null // this is a null  value 

//NOTE : if you check data type of null it will always show object --> this is a leagcy bug or error in js 
 */
// non primitive datatype in js 
// 1 array 
// 2 object 

// how to check a data type in js (use typeof)
//Number
let num = 23
console.log(num)
console.log(typeof num)
